# 100 Days Of Code - Log

DAY 1: 

Today I started my journey in learning Java. I learned how to first print using System.out.println("string");
Later learned how to take data from Stdin and oprint to Stdout. I retreived data from HackerRanks information and outputted the corrct solution.

Feeling a little bit nervous since I took an absence from coding and learning a new language, but super excited to start once again!

DAY 2: 

Today I worked on front end work with CSS/HTML Appplied Visual Design and a few more snippets of code into a personal project. Felt a bit exhaisted from work and lack of sleep I guess, but got it done. 

DAY 3: 

Today I did a bit more work on frontend and started more code with JavaScript, I made a Simple Guessing Game program without repition for now, but will come in the near future. Also added more to personal Project.

          //create secret number
          var secretNumber = 4;


          //ask user for guess
          var guess = prompt("Guess a number");

          //check guess
          if (Number(guess) === secretNumber) {
            alert("You got it!!");
          }

          //otherwise check if higher
          else if(Number(guess) > secretNumber) {
            alert("Too high, try again!");
          }

          //checks if lower
          else {
            alert("Too low, guess again!");
          }

DAY 4:

Today I practiced more with Applied Visual Design with frontend, and worked more with JavaScript. I am practicing on making websites a bit more dynamic!
