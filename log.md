# 100 Days Of Code - Log

DAY 1: 

Today I started my journey in learning Java. I learned how to first print using System.out.println("string");
Later learned how to take data from Stdin and oprint to Stdout. I retreived data from HackerRanks information and outputted the corrct solution.

Feeling a little bit nervous since I took an absence from coding and learning a new language, but super excited to start once again!

DAY 2: 

Today I worked on front end work with CSS/HTML Appplied Visual Design and a few more snippets of code into a personal project. Felt a bit exhaisted from work and lack of sleep I guess, but got it done.
